##Description
It's part entertainment and part message board.  Peforming regular message board functions such
as posting and having your posts upvoted by others will level up your TamaGAtchi.  Eventuall you'll be able to battle other TamaGAtchis, and have new ways to level up as more features are added to the message board.

## Outstanding Issues
- passing parameters or data to modal for the purpose of viewing or editing a post
- creating instance of tamagatchi after creating new user
- tamagatchi_path in link_to reset in index.html.erb
- cleaning up some routes which are short-cutted
- (modal) notification when user levels up
- HOW TO STORE MESSAGE ID IN MODAL????????????????????????????????????????????
- some error/status messages need to be cleared out after being displayed
- code needs some serious refactoring

## Next Steps
- improved integration between message board and TamaGAtchi leveling, including adding new features to provide additional ways to level up.
- better status messages
- password reset function
