# TamaGAtchi

Way more entertaining than the average message board.


## issues
- passing parameters or data to modal for the purpose of viewing a post
- creating instance of tamagatchi after creating new user, and synching data between the two
- putting javascript in separate .js file
- helper method tamagatchi_image in application_controller.rb
- tamagatchi_path in link_to reset in index.html.erb
- modal notification when user levels up
