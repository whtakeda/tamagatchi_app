# TamaGAtchi

https://blooming-stream-6851.herokuapp.com/

##Description
It's part entertainment and part message board.  Peforming regular message board functions such
as posting and having your posts upvoted by others will level up your TamaGAtchi.  Eventuall you'll be able to battle other TamaGAtchis, and have new ways to level up as more features are added to the message board.

##Technical Specs

This game is built using the following technologies

-HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the GUI
-Javascript and jQuery for some interaction between the GUI and Ruby
-Ruby and Rails for the routing and data logic
-ActiveRecord and Postgres for the database interaction

Built using Ruby on Rails with ActiveRecord, Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML, Postgresql

## Outstanding Issues
- passing parameters or data to modal for the purpose of viewing or editing a post
- creating instance of tamagatchi after creating new user
- tamagatchi_path in link_to reset in index.html.erb
- cleaning up some routes which are short-cutted
- (modal) notification when user levels up
- HOW TO STORE MESSAGE ID IN MODAL????????????????????????????????????????????
- some error/status messages need to be cleared out after being displayed
- code needs some serious refactoring
