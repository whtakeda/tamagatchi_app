# TamaGAtchi

A little bit of this and a litte bit of that

## issues
- passing parameters or data to modal for the purpose of viewing or editing a post
- creating instance of tamagatchi after creating new user, and synching data between the two
- helper method tamagatchi_image in application_controller.rb
- tamagatchi_path in link_to reset in index.html.erb
- modal notification when user levels up
- saving comments properly
- if user's post gets liked, tamagatchi score goes up
